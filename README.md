# Pozin Tech Services

Welcome to **Pozin Tech Services**, a student-led nonprofit initiative focused on providing affordable, custom-built PC solutions and repair services to students and community members. This project is part of a broader effort to promote digital literacy, hardware skills, and technology accessibility for youth in underserved or resource-limited environments.

## Mission

Our mission is simple:
> **Empower students through accessible, reliable, and educational technology solutions.**

We believe that every student deserves a reliable computer for education, productivity, creativity, and growth. Unfortunately, many face economic or technical barriers. Pozin Tech Services bridges that gap.

## Services Offered

### 🛠 Custom PC Builds
We provide tailored PC builds based on a student's budget and performance needs. Whether it’s a budget build for remote learning or a high-performance rig for engineering or design, we make it work.

### 🔧 Hardware Repair
Got a broken GPU fan? System won't boot? Our team helps diagnose, repair, and test hardware issues at no cost.

### 🧠 Free Consultations
We educate students on upgrades, help troubleshoot their tech issues, and offer transparent advice without any upselling or pressure.

## Why This Matters

**Technology should be empowering, not limiting.**

This project was born out of the realization that many students either lack reliable devices or don’t understand the basics of hardware maintenance. Through this project, we aim to:

- **Teach** students the fundamentals of computer hardware
- **Enable** access to powerful tools for education and career development
- **Demystify** building and repairing computers
